A Hybrid App uses the capabilities of both a [Data Client App](https://docs.developers.webflow.com/v2.0.0/docs/build-a-data-client) and a [Designer Extension](https://docs.developers.webflow.com/v2.0.0/docs/getting-started-1). Please read through our documentation to familiarize yourself with these concepts.",
